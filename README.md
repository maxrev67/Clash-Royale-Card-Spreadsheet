This graph shows the average win rate per rarity. The main takaway I got from this graph is that the lower the rarity is, the higher the winrate is. 

## Average Elixer Cost Per Rarity
<img width="800" height="500" alt="elixircost" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0139157-7bf5-45ee-8ad3-5e8a686d8340" />  

This graph displays the average elixer cost per rarity. We can see that the lower and more common rarities are cheaper in elixer.

Puting both graphs together I think that the lower rarities win more because the elixer cost for lower rarities are usually lower, so we can infer that the lower the average elixer cost of your deck is, the higher your win rate is.
